# High Level Capabilities needed for Prompt Development and Management

**Prompt Registry:**

* **Visual Prompt Template Creation:** Offers a user-friendly, no-code visual dashboard to create and edit prompt templates. This allows both technical and non-technical team members to contribute to prompt engineering.
* **Versioning:** Enables the tracking and management of different versions of prompts. Users can view changes, compare versions (diff), add notes and comments, and roll back to previous versions.
* **Organization:** Provides features to organize prompts using folders and snippets, preventing prompts from being scattered throughout the codebase.
* **Programmatic Retrieval:** Allows developers to retrieve specific prompt templates and versions directly within their code using the PromptLayer API.
* **Input Variables:** Supports the creation of dynamic prompts using input variables that can be filled at runtime. Different string parsing methods like f-strings and Jinja2 are supported.
* **Release Labels:** Enables the management of prompts across different environments (e.g., production, staging) by applying release labels to specific versions.

**Prompt Iteration & Testing:**

* **Interactive Prompt Testing:** Offers a playground environment where users can test prompts against different models and parameters.
* **Model Comparison:** Enables testing the same prompts across different LLM models to compare their outputs.
* **A/B Testing:** Facilitates the gradual release of new prompt versions and allows for comparison of their performance metrics.
* **Evaluation:** Provides tools to rigorously test prompts before deployment using both automated metrics and human graders.
* **Batch Testing:** Allows running prompts against datasets (historical or synthetic) to backtest, identify regressions, and validate updates.

**Collaboration:** [Pending]

* **Team Workspaces:** Supports team-based development with the ability to add members, assign roles, and share dashboards.
* **Access Control:** Allows control over who can edit prompts.
* **Sharing:** Enables sharing of entire dashboards or specific data segments with team members.

**Observability & Monitoring:** [Pending]

* **Request Logging:** Automatically logs all requests and responses made to LLM providers (like OpenAI) through the PromptLayer integration.
* **Metadata Tracking:** Records relevant metadata associated with each API request, such as the prompt used, response, and parameters.
* **Analytics Dashboard:** Provides a centralized view of LLM usage, including cost, latency statistics, and trends over time, broken down by feature or model.
* **Advanced Search:** Enables searching through the request history using metadata, tags, or keywords to triage errors and identify patterns.
* **Tracing:** Offers capabilities to visualize the execution flow of applications, track LLM requests, measure durations, and inspect inputs/outputs.
