This initiative focuses on establishing a comprehensive developer experience specifically designed for the creation of Generative AI applications, distinct from foundational model development and predictive AI implementations. Within the Generative AI application development lifecycle, a locally hosted model environment is generally essential for facilitating rigorous testing, streamlined prompt engineering, and effective experimentation with model outputs and contextual strategies.

The following outlines a non-exhaustive suite of capabilities required to support this developer experience, with the objective of enabling a localized development workflow prior to integration with frameworks such as Langchain, LangGraph, or Crew AI. The strategic intent for this concept is to identify and rapidly implement initial high-value features for market introduction, followed by continuous capability expansion.

**Key Capability Areas:**

* **Local Model Management:**[]
    * Provisioning and management of local model serving frameworks (e.g., Ollama).
    * [Model Management](https://github.com/mpaulgreen/ai_dev_experience_ideation/blob/main/model_management_ideation.md)
