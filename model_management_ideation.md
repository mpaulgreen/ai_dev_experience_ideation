![Model Management](./model_management.png)

## Core components

### Model Manager
- Downloads models via Ollama
- Lists available/downloaded models
- Manages model selection
- Controls model serving (start/stop)
- Monitors model status

### API Integration
- Connects to Ollama's API endpoints
- Provides API endpoint information to users
- Allows testing API connections

### UI Components
- Sidebar view for managing models
- Status bar indicator for active models
- Command palette integration
- Settings panel

## VS Code Ollama Plugin - High Level Design 
### Core Features
- Download: Users can search and download models directly from the Ollama registry
- Selection: Users can browse locally downloaded models and select one to activate
- Serving: Start/stop model serving with clear status indicators
- Status monitoring: See which models are running with memory usage stats

### API Integration
- Endpoint display: Shows the API endpoint URL for the running model
- Testing: Ability to test the API endpoint directly from VS Code
- Configuration: Port settings and other API parameters

### UI Components
- Sidebar extension: Quick access to model list and controls
- Status bar indicator: Shows currently running models at a glance
- Detailed view: In-depth model information and management in the main panel

### High Level Technical Architecture
### Backend
#### Ollama CLI Integration
- Interfaces with Ollama's command-line API for model management
- Executes commands like ollama pull, ollama list, ollama run


#### API Communication
- Connects to Ollama's REST API (typically on port 11434)
- Handles requests/responses for model operations and inference


#### Settings Management
- Stores user preferences and model configurations
- Manages paths and system resources



### Frontend

#### VS Code Extension API
- Registers commands, views, and UI components
- Creates TreeView for model listing
- Implements WebView panels for detailed interactions


#### User Interface
- Model listing with status indicators
- Control buttons for common operations
- Detailed model information panel
- Download interface with model browsing



### User Workflow

#### Initial Setup

- User installs VS Code extension
- Extension checks for Ollama installation, prompts if missing
- User configures basic settings (storage location, etc.)


#### Model Management
- Browse available models in the registry
- Download selected models with progress indication
- View locally available models in sidebar


#### Runtime Operations
- Start/stop models with a single click
- Monitor running model status
- Get API endpoint information
- Test connection directly from VS Code


#### Development Integration
- Copy API endpoint information for use in code
- Quick access to documentation
- Potential for code snippets integration
